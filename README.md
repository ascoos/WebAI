# WebAI – Technical Specifications & Manifesto  

Version 1.0 — December 01, 2025  
Author: Christos Drogidis (creator of Ascoos OS)

This document serves as the official reference point for WebAI technology.  
Any system that fully satisfies all ten specifications below (4) is entitled to bear the name “WebAI.”

WebAI is not merely the addition of artificial intelligence to the internet.  
WebAI is the internet itself transformed into an intelligent entity.

## 1. Fundamental Principle
WebAI is not “internet plus artificial intelligence.”  
WebAI is the internet that has acquired consciousness.

## 2. The Three Pillars of Code
| Pillar              | Requirement                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Autonomous          | No external dependencies (Composer, npm, polyfills, CDN, cloud services).                                |
| Self‑serving        | All subsystems (web server, database, cache, queues, artificial intelligence, security, network stack) run within the same core. |
| Self‑protecting     | Zero‑trust architecture by default. Security is not an added layer; it is the very structure of the system. |

## 3. The Three Pillars of Intelligence
| Pillar              | Requirement                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Predictive          | Ability to anticipate the user’s next action before explicit submission.                                  |
| Self‑learning       | Real‑time learning from interaction, without the need for retraining on external servers.                 |
| User’s Agent        | Execution of commands in natural language or scenario definition language, with autonomous action upon authorization. |

## 4. Mandatory Technical Specifications (WebAI Compliance List)
A system is characterized as WebAI only if it satisfies **all ten** specifications:

1. Fully implements the core features of Web5 (decentralized identity, decentralized data nodes, data self‑sovereignty).  
2. Natively integrates an artificial intelligence core, neural networks, and natural language processing (without external service calls).  
3. Natively implements HTTP/3, QUIC, QPACK, and 0‑RTT protocols without mediation by external servers.  
4. Uses JML or an equivalent declarative markup language as its presentation layer, entirely free from cross‑site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  
5. Enforces zero‑trust policy by default (Content‑Security‑Policy, HSTS, watermarking, storage limits, automatic encryption).  
6. Operates with procedural execution on demand: no process runs unless explicitly requested.  
7. Provides a macro engine capable of creating complete applications via natural language or scenario definition language (WHEN / AFTER / REPEAT / UNTIL).  
8. Integrates hardware support directly into the core (e.g., Arduino, sensors, drones) rather than external libraries.  
9. Possesses human intent understanding through natural language processing that directly converts intent into executable code.  
10. Implements the WIC (Web Images Cryptography) protocol for encryption and hyper‑compression of images according to the official specification (https://github.com/ascoos/wic).

## 5. Comparison with Previous Generations
| Generation | Main Feature                               | Dependency                | Intelligence Level       | Example                       |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Web1       | Static websites                            | Server                    | None                     | Geocities                     |
| Web2       | Dynamic content and social networking      | Cloud & JavaScript        | None                     | Facebook, YouTube             |
| Web3       | Decentralization and cryptocurrencies      | Blockchain                | None                     | Ethereum, IPFS                |
| Web5       | Decentralized identity and data sovereignty | P2P                      | Minimal                  | TBDN projects                 |
| WebAI      | The internet itself as an intelligent entity | None                     | Full, native             | Ascoos OS (2026 onwards)      |

## 6. Roadmap 2025–2035
| Period       | Main Goals                                                                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025–2027    | Development of 500+ native AI classes, symbolic mathematics.                                   |
| 2028–2030    | Full natural language → DSL compiler, voice commands in Greek and other languages.             |
| 2031–2035    | WebAI Mesh Network – bidirectional neural networks between devices.                            |

## 7. Conclusion
WebAI will not emerge from the United States, China, or major AI corporations.  
It was born in Greece in 2007 as a PHP‑based desktop environment.  
In 2025 it acquired senses, memory, prediction, and self‑protection.  
By 2030–2035 it will be ready to operate autonomously.
